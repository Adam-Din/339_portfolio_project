            <h2 id='goal'>Goal</h2>
            <p id='goalp'> The goal of Chess is to capture you opponents king. This is called checkmate and happens
                when the king can not make a legal move to escape being captured by an opposing players piece. 
                A piece captures another piece by moving on to a square that is occupied by an opposing piece. 
                There are many different ways to achieve checkmate but first you need to learn the basics.

                    <img src='images/pawn.png' alt='pawn' class='piecePic'>
                    <p class='description'>Pawns can only move forward one square at a time, except for their very first move where 
                    they can move forward two squares. Despite this, pawns can only capture an opposing piece 
                    that is one square diagonally in front of them.</p>
                    
                </li>
                <li>

                    <img src='images/knight.png' alt='knight' class='piecePic'>
                    <p class='description'>Knights move in the shape of an "L". They can move 2 squares in any direction plus one square in 
                        any direction. Knights are also the only piece that can "jump" over other pieces. All other pieces can not
                        move through pieces of the same color. </p>
                    
                </li>

                    <img src='images/bishop.png' alt='bishop' class='piecePic'>
                    <p class='description'>Bishops can move as far as they want, but only along a diagonal. This makes it so a bishop must 
                        stay on the color square (light or dark) that it starts on. Since one bishop is on each color, they work well together.</p>

                    <p class='description'>Rooks can move as far as they want, but only forwards, backwards, or to the sides. </p>

                <li>

                    <img src='images/queen.png' alt='queen' class='piecePic'>
                    <p class='description'>Queens can move as far as they want in one straight direction. This includes diagonally, forward, backward, and to the sides.
                       This makes queens the most powerful piece since it can move in the most directions.

                    <img src='images/king.png' alt='king' class='piecePic'>
                    <p class='description'>The King can move in any direction, like the queen, but only one square at a time. Despite the King being the most important piece
                        this makes it one of the weakest. A King can also never move into "check" and must move out of "check". Check means that the King is on a square on which it can be 
                        captured by another piece.

            <h2>Checkmate</h2>
            <p>There are lots of unique ways to force the opposing King into checkmate and win the game. Here are a few examples below so you can get a basic understanding.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class='backRank'>
                    <h3 class='mateName'>Back Rank Checkmate</h3>
                    <p class='mateDescription'>One of the most common checkmates is along the back rank (or row). Here the king can't move off 0f the back rank while a rook or queen attacks it along that row.</p>
                    <img src='images/back_rank.png' alt='back rank checkmate' class='matePic'>
                </li>
                <li class='somthered'>
                    <h3 class='mateName'>Smothered Mate</h3>
                    <p class='mateDescription'>The smothered mate can only happen when the king is completely trapped by its own pieces. This allows a knight to attack it on one square and end the game.</p>
                    <img src='images/smothered.png' alt='smothered mate' class='matePic'>
                </li>
                <li class='scholars'>
                    <h3 class='mateName'>Scholars Mate</h3>
                    <p class='mateDescription'>The scholars mate is one of the most well-known check mates since it can be accomploished in just four moves. In this checkmate the bishop protects the queen which gives the king no safe squares and ends the game.</p>
