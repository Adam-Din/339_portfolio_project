        <h2 class='intro'>What is Chess?</h2>
        <img src="images/chess_board.jpeg" alt="chess board and pieces" class="intro">
        <p class='intro'>Chess is a popular board game played between two players. It is an abstract strategy
            game that is played on a board of 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. 
            People have been playing chess for hundreds of years and as a result have developed 
            complex strategies and tactics to outsmart their opponents and win the game. Today, chess 
            is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide both causually 
            and competitively.</p>
        
        <h2 class='origin'>Origins</h2>
        <img src="images/artifact.jpeg" alt="old chess pieces" class='origin'>
        <p class='origin'>The first game that resembles modern day chess orginated in India in the early 7th century.
           This game was called "chaturanga" and used many of the same pieces that chess still uses today. 
           From there chess spread to Persia, through the Arabic world and eventually to Europe by the year 
           1000. While chess continued to spread around the world it was most popular in Europe and by the late
           15th century chess began to resemble it's modern form. In modern times, competitive chess has lead to
           the creation of chess theory and increased the popularity of the game greatly.</p>

        <img src="images/fide_logo.png" alt="FIDE logo" class='fide'>
        <p class='fide'>The International Chess Federation, more commonly known as FIDE (from its French translation) was
                created in 1924 in Paris. Today it is based in Switzerland and acts as the governing body of 
                international chess competition. Currently there are 195 member federations in FIDE that host 
                tournaments or other forms of competitive chess. FIDE organizes world championships for women,
                men, juniors, seniors, and the disabled. FIDE also awards titles such as Grandmaster to accomplished
                players, puzzle composers, and puzzle solvers.
